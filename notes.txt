Stuff I'm using in no particular order:
WEBPACK: builds it for module distribution
BABEL: transpiles for webpack
ESLINT: helps me not fuck up writing it
RSG: generates a nice styleguide to `serve`
NPM: puts this on the internet

Stuff I'm not using (but should shake the tree to make sure):
REACT HOT LOADER
EXPRESS
WEBPACK DEV SERVER

look into this for more active development:
https://github.com/theogravity/react-styleguide-generator-alt
(swaps out browserify for webpack, supports hot-loading & dev server)

look into password protection with serve module
